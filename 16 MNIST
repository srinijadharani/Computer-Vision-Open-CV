MNIST DATASET: Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology
 
The MNIST database of handwritten digits (0-9), available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
(28 x 28 pixels). Each digit is represented as an array. The pixels are normalized.
