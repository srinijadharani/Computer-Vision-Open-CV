MNIST DATASET: Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology
 
The MNIST database of handwritten digits (0-9), available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
(28 x 28 pixels). Each digit is represented as an array. The pixels are normalized. 

One Hot Encoding: If the original image is '5', the label to this corresponding image will be 5. If the image is 2, the label will be 2.
This encoding can easily be done using Keras.

The label is represented based on the index position in the label array. The corresponding label will be at a 1 and the rest will be 0.
For example, a drawn digit of 6 will have the label array: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]
